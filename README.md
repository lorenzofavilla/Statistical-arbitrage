Hi there!

Welcome to my project from the "Fintech and Machine Learning for Finance" course taught by Professor Corielli at Bocconi University. I started with the original code from Prof Corielli and added my own twist with the "Statistical Arbitrage 2" section.

In this project, you'll find various implementations involving rolling regressions, residual analysis, and a mean-reverting trading strategy. The dataset used includes weekly prices and returns from the Eurostoxx financials.

Feel free to check it out, and don't hesitate to drop any comments or recommendations!

Cheers,

Lorenzo
