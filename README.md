Hi there!

Welcome to my project from the "Fintech and Machine Learning for Finance" course taught by Professor Corielli at Bocconi University. I started with the original code from Prof Corielli and added my own twist with the "Statistical Arbitrage 2" section.

The project revolves around 4 functions:

1. ROLLING REGRESSION FUNCTION: Utilizing historical data to predict future trends through a dynamic window approach.
2. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS FUNCTION: Analyzing data dimensions to identify patterns and reduce noise.
3. PAIRS TRADING STRATEGY (RANDOM FUNCTION): Employing random selection to form trading pairs and test market efficiency.
4. PAIRS TRADING STRATEGY (CLUSTERING FUNCTION): Using advanced clustering techniques to group similar financial instruments and optimize trading strategies.

Weekly prices and returns from the Eurostoxx financials dataset were used.

Feel free to check it out, and don't hesitate to drop any comments or recommendations!

Cheers,

Lorenzo
