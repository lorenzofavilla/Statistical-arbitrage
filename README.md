Hi there!

This project was part of the course "Fintech and machine learning for finance" taught by Professor Corielli at Bocconi University.
The original code was written by Prof Corielli; I implemented and added the second part of the file "Statistical arbitrage 2".

Feel free to reach out for comments or recs!
